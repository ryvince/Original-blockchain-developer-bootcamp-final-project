 Repo for bootcamp final project

Initial idea for final project:
NFT Minting DApp with built-in randomizer

Purpose: Allow users to register once for an NFT drop, select random winners that can go on to mint NFT within a given period

Problems solved: 
    1. Trustless, transparent selection of winners for highly anticipated projects (or promotional giveaways)
    2. Avoid gas wars during minting by allowing selected winners to mint NFTs over a longer time period

Example Workflow:
    1. Users would have to register on the app, with wallet address
    2. Select NFT project
    3. Select amount they want to mint
    4. Solve some type of captcha or puzzle to stop bots
    5. After registration closes, the app would randomly select the number of winners based on quantity provided by the Devs of ther NFT project
    6. winning wallets would be posted to the blockchain to allow for minting during periods of lower gas fees
